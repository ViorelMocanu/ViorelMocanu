# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects including [Pentest-Tools.com](https://pentest-tools.com/) (on my alternative GitHub account [viorel-mocanu-ptt](https://github.com/viorel-mocanu-ptt)) and [my own YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/ViorelMocanu).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on creating easy to use starter projects for people beginning their journey in IT, front end, back end, devops, etc.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with editing my YouTube videos and QA for the projects I'm building pro bono.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to start a career in design or development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/UpnAutz), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ViorelMocanu), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ViorelMocanu), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viorelmocanu/) or [my personal site](https://www.viorelmocanu.ro/) (in ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´ Romanian only for now, planning to start an ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¸ English version soon).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started out in Front End Development in the 1990's, when [Jeffrey Zeldman](https://www.zeldman.com/) (with [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/)) and others were fighting to create and uphold Web Standards. We now live by them and it's a wonderful time to start working in the field, so I'm devoting part of my time to encourage you to do so.
